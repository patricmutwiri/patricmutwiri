## 📃 Documentation & Process  

As an **engineer**, I enjoy solving problems. As an **architect**, I recognize the critical role of documentation.  

Key questions I always ask:  
```markdown
- Who is the customer?
- What’s the problem?
- What are the proposed solutions?
- Who’s responsible for what, when, and how?
```
**Business Continuity Planning (BCP)** is vital. It’s not just about preferences—it’s about ensuring resilience and clarity in every project.
