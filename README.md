## üìÉ Documentation
BCP is important - it's not about whether as an engineer I like this. As an architect, documentation is key. I like taking notes to help me figure out:  
```markdown
- Who's the customer?
- What's the problem?
- What's the proposed solutions?
- Who's doing what, where, when and how?
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è My Setup
I like speed and comfort.
